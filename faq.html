								</header>
								<em>Watch this space. We will continue edit this and add to it as questions, comments, praise and criticisms come in. We want this to be an open dialog. Email <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=FAQ">info@newlibs.org</a> to ask questions.</em></p>

										<h3>Content & Content Types</h3>
									</header>
									<p>For every journal article that is submitted, we really hope that we get five submissions that we have no idea how to categorize. We want to bend the idea of what scholarly and professional output looks like, and this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>We want lengthy treatises on intersectionality and library practice just as much as we want data analysis and recorded interviews with people doing awesome teen programming or video projects on the transformation of a library's physical space and the perceived impact. All aspects of librarianship - by any name - are within the intended scope of the journal. No submission will be rejected merely because it espouses a particular view. The well reasoned, well structured argument will always be welcome.  We will always make sure that the appropriate peer reviewers are selected for the content in question. If we’re able, we think it would be great to have track leaders on our board who will make sure that we're publishing the best in that segment of the field.</p>

										<h3>Diversity</h3>
									</header>
									<p><em>Journal of New Librarianship</em> is a community project. We have a strong ongoing and constant commitment to diversity & inclusion. Notably, the staff of the journal share a steadfast commitment to recognizing and discussing intersectionality - how social categories like race, class, and gender create overlapping and situational systems of discrimination and privilege. Regardless of our backgrounds and experiences, we are be committed to discussing biases on the part of ourselves and others in making progress within libraries and societies. 

<p>All involved with the journal will work to  ensure it has not just guidance but leadership from a group of professionals that reflects our community. We will endeavor to make sure that the content we solicit encourages and champions that same diversity. We will continue to evolve as an organization, which will include expansion/remixing of the roles and responsibilities of leadership & editorial board in order to best these goals as well as our role as platform for the profession.</p>

										<h3>Open Access Policy</h3>
									</header>
<p><em>Journal of New Librarianship</em> is an Open Access publication following the diamond model. What does this mean? It means that no one will be charged to submit content, nor will anyone ever be charged to view the content. Our default rights status for all material is CC-BY. We encourage contributors to apply a CC-0 license if they would prefer, but would rather not move in the other direction. Our organization is 100% volunteer. Fees are not paid for reviews or articles. Operating costs are being defrayed by the editors and their institutions.</p>

<p>Why diamond? The founding EIC and Managing Editor are strongly OA-oriented. We believe that the production of our profession and of the institutions we serve should be freely available to all, and not held ransom by a commercial entity. Likewise, anyone who has produced scholarly or professional output has doubtlessly invested their time, financial and institutional resources into their work. They should not be asked to pay an additional “processing fee.”</p>

<p>The author/contributor is the ultimate authority on their work, retains all rights to that work, and has absolute control over it.</p>

										<h3>Aspects & Avenues of the Profession(s)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The journal's name has the word "library" in it for a reason. We don't expect this to be a journal about business intelligence. I expect it to be a place where people can publish their work, in whatever form it might take, openly.</p>

<p>I don't think, at least at the onset, that we need to choose libraries vs information science, theory vs data, one over the other, but instead try to offer space to anything that is worthwhile within the profession. We don't have a minimum number of articles/content objects that we have to publish publish, nor a max. But we hope to be overwhelmed.</p>

										<h3>Student Involvement</h3> 									
									</header>
<p>Students are encouraged to submit works of all kinds for consideration. The journal will strive to showcase student work regularly alongside the work of our professional community.</p>

<p>Students are welcome to volunteer to be a part of the JONL editorial team. They will be vetted and approved using the same standards that other editorial board participants are measured by. Those with limited credentials are encouraged to apply to participate with a letter of recommendation from a faculty member.</p>

<p>We will develop roles in which students can contribute to the free flow of information through the publishing process, with the intent of providing experiential learning opportunities for them in meaningful, non-exploitative ways.</p>

<p>Students who participate will not do so in exchange for credit towards their degree. The opportunity is for professional development, not to fulfill requirements for which they would presumably pay their graduate program.</p>

										<h3>Website</h3> 									
									</header>

<p>Since it is a github page, there are (in some cases too exhaustive) records of what gets changed. As we get more folks on board, we'll definitely be treating the website as a public project in a lot of ways, in order to make sure that the mission remains fluid, and that we're performing what the community needs us to perform. If you’d like to be added to the project team, please email <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=Github">info@newlibs.org</a> with your github handle.</p>

<p>As of 3.17.16 we have added SSL via Cloudflare. This is not 100%. We're keen on the page being on Github to allow for more participation. If anyone has ideas, please drop us a line.</p>

										<h3>Descriptions & Copy</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We needed to start somewhere, and this is where we landed. Our main criticism so far has been that there’s not enough information available yet. Our mission and goals will be malleable and can and should be based on the changing nature of the field. Our editorial board will help us define where we should be honing in, and to help us pivot when it is prudent to do so. If you want clarification about something, ask us by emailing <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=Copy">info@newlibs.org</a>. I will make sure it is clarified, and will include the reasons for the changes in the site’s changelog.</p>

										<h3>Radicalism & Disruption</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The word "Radicalism" was originally included on our website in the description of the examination of the field we intended to embark on. It is not there now because many people took issue with it. I personally hope that the word is used again in describing what we’re trying to do, because I believe that it fits.</p>

<p>First, we would like to acknowledge the great work that <a href="https://journal.radicallibrarianship.org/index.php/journal/index" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Radical Librarianship</em></a> and others are doing to get this conversation moving in the field. Ian Clark’s <a href="https://journal.radicallibrarianship.org/index.php/journal/article/view/12" target="_blank">piece that came out this week on privacy</a> was really inspiring and amazing. We see ourselves sharing that space with those who are already there, and hopefully filling in gaps with our content approach. In other words, we are hoping to be able to provide a more disruptive approach to scholarly and professional communication methods, in addition to more traditional journal publishing. So, the method of our examination (and hopefully some of the content itself) is quite possibly radical.</p>
