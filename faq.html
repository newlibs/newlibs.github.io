									<h2>FAQs</h2>
								</header>
								<em>Watch this space. We will continue edit this and add to it as questions, comments, praise and criticisms come in. We want this to be an open dialog. Email <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=FAQ">info@newlibs.org</a> to ask questions.</em></p>

										<h3>Content & Content Types</h3>
									</header>
									<p>For every journal article that is submitted, we really hope that we get five submissions that we have no idea how to categorize. We want to bend the idea of what scholarly and professional output looks like, and this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>We want lengthy treatises on intersectionality and library practice just as much as we want data analysis and recorded interviews with people doing awesome teen programming or video projects on the transformation of a library's physical space and the perceived impact. All aspects of librarianship - by any name - are within the intended scope of the journal. No submission will be rejected merely because it espouses a particular view. The well reasoned, well structured argument will always be welcome.  We will always make sure that the appropriate peer reviewers are selected for the content in question. If we’re able, we think it would be great to have track leaders on our board who will make sure that we're publishing the best in that segment of the field.</p>
									</section>

										<h3>Diversity</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. We are three white dudes who decided to start a journal with the goal of upending the conversation about librarianship. Our libraries are not homogeneous, and this journal won’t be either. The reason we did our pseudo-soft-launch before we had our full board was because we wanted to make sure that anyone could raise their hand to be a part of the changing conversation. We want people who are hungry to identify the new directions or profession is headed in (indeed, the conversation that brought us here came about after Journal of Library Innovation announced it would close shop) and to help showcase the work of their peers.</p>

<p>That said, we have privilege, and must be totally and completely conscious of that. The journal must make sure it has not just guidance but leadership from a group of professionals that reflects our community. We must make sure that the content we solicit encourages and champions that same diversity. As we grow and recruit the board, everything will change, hopefully including who is at the helm. That is the whole point.</p>
									</section>

									<header>
										<h3>Aspects & Avenues of the Profession(s)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The journal's name has the word "library" in it for a reason. We don't expect this to be a journal about business intelligence. I expect it to be a place where people can publish their work, in whatever form it might take, openly.</p>

<p>I don't think, at least at the onset, that we need to choose libraries vs information science, theory vs data, one over the other, but instead try to offer space to anything that is worthwhile within the profession. We don't have a minimum number of articles/content objects that we have to publish publish, nor a max. But we hope to be overwhelmed.</p>
									</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Website</h3> 									
									</header>

<p>Since it is github page, there are (in some cases too exhaustive) records of what gets changed. As we get more folks on board, we'll definitely be treating the website as a public project in a lot of ways, in order to make sure that the mission remains fluid, and that we're performing what the community needs us to perform. If you’d like to be added to the project team, please email <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=Github">info@newlibs.org</a> with your github handle.</p>

										<h3>Descriptions & Copy</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We needed to start somewhere, and this is where we landed. Our main criticism so far has been that there’s not enough information available yet. Our mission and goals will be malleable and can and should be based on the changing nature of the field. Our editorial board will help us define where we should be honing in, and to help us pivot when it is prudent to do so. If you want clarification about something, ask us by emailing <a href="mailto:info@newlibs.org?Subject=Copy">info@newlibs.org</a>. I will make sure it is clarified, and will include the reasons for the changes in the site’s changelog.</p>

										<h3>Radicalism & Disruption</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The word “Radicalism" was originally included on our website in the description of the examination of the field we intended to embark on. It is not there now because many people took issue with it. I personally hope that the word is used again in describing what we’re trying to do, because I believe that it fits.</p>

<p>First, we would like to acknowledge the great work that Journal of Radical Librarianship and others are doing to get this conversation moving in the field. Ian Clark’s piece that came out this week on privacy was really inspiring and amazing. We see ourselves sharing that space with those who are already there, and hopefully filling in gaps with our content approach. In other words, we are hoping to be able to provide a more disruptive approach to scholarly and professional communication methods, in addition to more traditional journal publishing. So, the method of our examination (and hopefully some of the content itself) is quite possibly radical.</p>
